  <h4>Childhood</h4>
  <div style="display:flex; width:100%; overflow:hidden;">
    <p class="early">Linus Benedict Torvalds was born in Helsinki, Finland, on December 28, 1969. His name was taken from the famous physical chemist.Torvalds’ family was mostly journalists. His father, Nils Torvalds, was a Communist who studied in Moscow. His mother, Anna Torvalds, worked as a translator and creator of news graphics.</p><div style="display:flex; align-items:center; justify-content:center; width:100%;"><img style="width:200px; height:200px;" src="pics/baby_sir.jpg"/></div></div>
    <p>Torvalds’ childhood was conventional and full of happiness, even though his parents were divorced at a young age. His grandfather, Leo Toerngvist, had a great influence on young Linus.Toerngvist bought a Commodore Vic 20, which was one of the first personal computers during the mid-1970s. Torvalds became very fond of the computer, but later on, he became bored with the limited programs. Thus, he began creating new programs using the Basic Programming Language. Later on, he used a more powerful but difficult assembly language.</p>
    
    <p>At the age of 18 years old, Torvalds bought his first computer, the Sinclair QL, with his savings.However, Torvalds became dissatisfied because the computer could not be reprogrammed. After all, the operating system resided in ROM.
    In the year 1988, Torvalds attended the University of Helsinki, the same university his parents attended. Torvalds was considered to be an accomplished programmer at that time, and naturally, he majored in computer science.
    Torvalds had his first class in C Programming Language in 1990, and he also used C programming language in writing the Linux Kernel.</p>
